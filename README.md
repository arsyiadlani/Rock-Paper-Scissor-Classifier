# rock-paper-scissor-classifier
A simple Convolutional Neural Network project in google colaboratory to classify rock-paper-scissor hand image with:
* Keras Image Data Generator as data augmentation
* Keras Sequential model as convolutional neural network architecture
* categorical_crossentropy as the loss function of the model and Adam as model optimizer
* Model loss and accuracy score visualization
